For this task, I developed a fully functional Calculator Application using Java Swing, recreating both the logic and the interface of a modern mobile calculator.

🖥️ Project Overview

I built an interactive GUI Calculator that performs basic arithmetic operations such as:

Addition

Subtraction

Multiplication

Division

Percentage

Square root

Sign toggle (+/-)

Decimal input

AC / Reset functionality

The design includes:

Custom color themes

A grid-based keypad

A dynamic display panel

Proper input handling

Error handling (e.g., invalid square roots)

The entire application is developed using Java Swing, AWT, and event-driven programming, with all button actions handled through listeners.

📌 About the Code (Short Description)

The program uses:

JFrame to create the main application window

JPanel with GridLayout to structure the calculator buttons

JLabel as the display screen

Custom styling using Color, Font, and LineBorder

Dynamic event handling via ActionListener

Arithmetic logic implemented using variables a, b, and operator

Utility methods like clearAll() and removeZeroDecimal() to keep results clean

The calculator is smart enough to handle chained operations, validate inputs, and present results without unnecessary decimal points.

🎯 What I Learned

This task helped me strengthen my foundational skills in:

✔️ Java Swing GUI Development

Building windows, layouts, components, and real-time interaction.

✔️ Event Handling

Using ActionListener to capture user inputs and drive application logic.

✔️ Object-Oriented Logic Structure

Splitting UI handling and calculation logic clearly.

✔️ Custom UI Styling

Using fonts, colors, layouts, and borders to create a modern look.

✔️ String & Number Handling

Converting display text to numeric values and producing clean results.

✔️ Problem-Solving Through GUI Behavior

Managing user interactions such as decimal inputs, operator clicks, and error states.
